## Comprehensive Analysis of alchemy-gen Project State

Based on my analysis, here's the current state of the project and what needs to be added for Phase 1:

### What Already Exists:

1. **Basic Project Setup:**
   - `package.json` with only one dependency: `ts-poet: ^6.12.0`
   - `README.md` with comprehensive project documentation
   - `mise.toml` configured with Bun 1.2.19 and proper Node.js path/env settings
   - `bun.lockb` lock file
   - Project documentation in `todos/` directory

2. **Git Repository:**
   - Clean git repository on main branch
   - Recent commits show initial setup

3. **Documentation:**
   - Clear project description and architecture outlined
   - Comprehensive task breakdown for all implementation phases

### What's Missing for Phase 1:

1. **Core Dependencies Not Installed:**
   - @effect/cli (CLI framework)
   - @effect/platform (HTTP API framework with OpenApiJsonSchema)
   - @effect/schema (Schema validation)
   - TypeScript itself
   - Type definitions (@types/node, etc.)

2. **TypeScript Configuration:**
   - No `tsconfig.json` file exists
   - No TypeScript compiler configured

3. **Project Structure:**
   - No `src/` directory (though docs mention `lib/` as empty)
   - No `tests/` directory
   - No `examples/` directory

4. **Linting/Formatting Tools:**
   - No Biome configuration
   - No ESLint or Prettier setup

5. **Development Scripts:**
   - No npm scripts defined in package.json
   - No build, test, or lint commands configured

6. **Environment Files:**
   - No `.env` file (though mise.toml is configured to load it)
   - No `.gitignore` file visible

### Key Observations:

1. The project uses Bun as the runtime (v1.2.19)
2. The architecture is well-documented, focusing on using Effect's `OpenApiJsonSchema` utilities
3. The project aims to generate Effect Platform HttpApi implementations from OpenAPI specs
4. ts-poet is already installed for code generation

### Next Steps for Phase 1:

To complete Phase 1, you need to:
1. Install the missing core dependencies
2. Create and configure TypeScript with proper Effect support
3. Set up the project directory structure
4. Initialize and configure Biome for linting/formatting
5. Add development scripts to package.json
6. Study the OpenApiJsonSchema documentation from @effect/platform

The project has a solid foundation with clear documentation and goals, but needs the technical infrastructure to be set up before development can begin.
