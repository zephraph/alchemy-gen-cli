# Phase 1: Project Setup
**Status:** InProgress
**Agent PID:** 13506

## Original Todo
- [ ] Install core dependencies (@effect/cli, @effect/platform, @effect/schema, ts-poet)
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration with proper Effect support
- [ ] Create basic project structure (src/, tests/, examples/)
- [ ] Configure Biome for linting and formatting
- [ ] Study OpenApiJsonSchema from @effect/platform documentation

## Description
Set up the foundational infrastructure for the alchemy-gen CLI tool. This includes installing the core Effect ecosystem dependencies (@effect/cli, @effect/platform, @effect/schema), configuring TypeScript for proper Effect support, creating the basic project directory structure (src/, tests/, examples/), and setting up Biome for code quality. Also includes initial exploration of OpenApiJsonSchema utilities from @effect/platform that will be crucial for the project's core functionality.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Install core dependencies: bun add @effect/cli @effect/platform @effect/schema typescript @types/node @types/bun
- [ ] Create tsconfig.json with Effect-compatible settings and strict mode
- [ ] Create project directory structure: mkdir -p src tests examples
- [ ] Initialize Biome: bun add --dev @biomejs/biome && bunx biome init
- [ ] Configure Biome with VCS mode: Update biome.json to use git for file discovery
- [ ] Add development scripts to package.json (build, test, lint, format, typecheck)
- [ ] Create initial src/index.ts entry point with basic Effect import
- [ ] Create .gitignore file with standard Node.js/TypeScript patterns
- [ ] Study OpenApiJsonSchema docs and create examples/openapi-exploration.ts with basic usage
- [ ] User test: Run 'bun run typecheck' and 'bun run lint' to verify setup
