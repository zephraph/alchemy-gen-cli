# Phase 1: Project Setup
**Status:** AwaitingCommit
**Agent PID:** 18189

## Original Todo
- [ ] Install core dependencies (@effect/cli, @effect/platform, @effect/schema, ts-poet)
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration with proper Effect support
- [ ] Create basic project structure (src/, tests/, examples/)
- [ ] Configure Biome for linting and formatting
- [ ] Study OpenApiJsonSchema from @effect/platform documentation

## Description
Set up the foundational infrastructure for the alchemy-gen CLI tool. This includes installing the core Effect ecosystem dependencies (@effect/cli, @effect/platform, @effect/schema), configuring TypeScript for proper Effect support, creating the basic project directory structure (src/, tests/, examples/), and setting up Biome for code quality. Also includes initial exploration of OpenApiJsonSchema utilities from @effect/platform that will be crucial for the project's core functionality.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Install core dependencies: bun add @effect/cli @effect/platform @effect/schema typescript @types/node @types/bun
- [x] Create tsconfig.json with Effect-compatible settings and strict mode
- [x] Create project directory structure: mkdir -p src tests examples
- [x] Initialize Biome: bun add --dev @biomejs/biome && bunx biome init
- [x] Configure Biome with VCS mode: Update biome.json to use git for file discovery
- [x] Add development scripts to package.json (build, test, lint, format, typecheck)
- [x] Create initial src/index.ts entry point with basic Effect import
- [x] Create .gitignore file with standard Node.js/TypeScript patterns
- [x] Study OpenApiJsonSchema docs and create examples/openapi-exploration.ts with basic usage
- [x] User test: Run 'bun run typecheck' and 'bun run lint' to verify setup

## Notes
Successfully completed Phase 1 project setup with all dependencies installed, proper TypeScript and Biome configuration, and working Effect Platform examples. Project structure is ready for CLI development with comprehensive OpenAPI exploration examples demonstrating HttpApi and OpenApiJsonSchema usage patterns.
